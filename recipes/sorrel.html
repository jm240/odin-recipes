    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Sorrel</strong>is a sweet, gingery, wine-hued Jamaican drink best served cold. Its primary ingredient, the blossoms of the hibiscus plant, were originally harvested and cultivated in the Caribbean</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>150g, about 3 cups dried sorrel (hibiscus), rinsed with cold water in a colander or strainer</li>
        <li>350g peel-on fresh ginger, washed and grated</li>
        <li>10 whole cloves</li>
        <li>10 allspice berries, roughly crushed with the side of a knife</li>
        <li>495g, about 2 1/2 cups sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a 4- or 5-quart pot or Dutch oven, bring 3 quarts water to a boil. Add sorrel, grated ginger, cloves, and crushed allspice, and boil until the sorrel begins to plump and swell, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let stand until cooled, then continue to steep in an airtight vessel in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours and up to 3 days.</li>
        <li>Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer or through cheesecloth into a large pitcher, pressing on solids to express as much liquid as possible. If needed, strain again until it is clear of any ginger remnants. Discard solids.</li>
        <li>In a 2-quart saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil with the sugar. Continue to cook, stirring, until sugar has completely dissolved. Remove simple syrup from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir simple syrup into the strained sorrel, 1/2 cup at a time, until desired sweetness level is reached.</li>
        <li>Chill until ready to drink. Serve over ice.</li>
    </ol>
